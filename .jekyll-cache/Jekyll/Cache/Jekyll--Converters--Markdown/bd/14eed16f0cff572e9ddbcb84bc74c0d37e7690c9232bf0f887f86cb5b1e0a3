    <p>
        You'll need to decide what you're going to make once you've decided what product you need to make. What exactly is it? You must decide what you will do because this will serve as a means of communication with your team, allowing you to fully comprehend the problem and write a code solution. User story has become almost synonymous with agile in many teams, though non-agile user story can also be used. From the perspective of your target users, user stories represent what will be a new feature of a system. This is how you usually write them:
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #D9D9D6;" class="p-1">
        <b>As <i>someone</i>, I'd like <i>to do something</i>. In order for me to <i>achieve something</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hypothesis-driven development, or an ad-hoc approach like writing on the back of an index card, is another option. Consider the following scenario:
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #D9D9D6;" class="p-1">
        <b><i>As a user, I'd like to create an account. In order for me to be able to check out faster the next time.</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now comes the big question: is it really necessary for the user to check more quickly? Irrational user stories should be avoided. You might even lose interest in your effort now that they don't need to check it right away. If they do this, the user story above might make sense.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #D9D9D6;" class="p-1">
        <b><i>[1]As a business, [2]I'd like to create an account. [3]In order for me to learn more about my customers, and because customers with accounts are more likely to return to the app, according to research.</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unreasonable user stories often occur in number 3. This line is difficult to write because the content still needs quite a bit of explanation. Number 2 is depend on your team's discussion. The phrase <i>As a user</i> is one of the indicators of irrational user stories. The first line above cannot be applied to another user because everyone's needs are different. It's critical to know the difference between them when designing a user-friendly product. It's a good idea to create a persona for them so that you can give them a sense of identity. It can be difficult to write a user story because it covers such a broad range of technology.
    </p>
    <p>
       However, you can turn these user stories into epics, which are similar to user stories but are broken up into smaller chunks. Epics might look something like this if you're making a personal management app: 
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #D9D9D6;" class="p-1">
        <b><i>[1]As a customer, I'd like to manage my activity. In order for me to be fully productive.</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be broken down into small user stories based on various customer activities. Prioritizing these individual user stories is simple. Prioritizing large user stories will be difficult and will cause problems for your team. Because there are unnecessary tasks that arise as a result of a system's unnecessary features.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Bill Wake suggests a mnemonic to help you remember the key elements of a user story. This is referred to as INVEST:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>I</b>ndependent</li>
            <li><b>N</b>egotiable</li>
            <li><b>V</b>aluable</li>
            <li><b>E</b>stimatable</li>
            <li><b>S</b>mall</li>
            <li><b>T</b>estable</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The user story is self-contained and does not rely on other user stories. This means you can move it up or down in your backlog at any time. Because of the ability to negotiate, the user story can be changed or abandoned at any time. If your user story has a technical issue, for example, your team can either find another user story or discard it entirely. To make sense, your user story must also be valuable. A user story that keeps you busy but adds little value to your team should be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some teams assign a point value to an item, which aids us in prioritizing those items. The low-cost item has a high priority, while the high-cost item has a low priority. The user story is also estimated for this reason. It's difficult to prioritize a user story if you don't estimate it. If this isn't accurately estimated, there's a problem with the meaning of a user story. This means that if a user story's meaning is incorrect, it cannot be implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small is another feature of a good user story. However, it is contingent on your team's rules. Other teams are competing in a sprint, so the user story must be brief for them. There are other teams that run in the same sprint as well, and it's fine with them if the user story is large as long as they're comfortable with it. The big user story is easy to overlook, resulting in wasted time and effort. The user story is testable, and the final INVEST requirement is required. There is no other way for the team to know if the user story is properly placed in the backlog if it is not testable. When a requirement is not testable, it may lack meaning, and this lack of meaning leads to a user story that cannot be assigned value points.
    </p>
    <p>
      These INVEST requirements also contradict one another. If you want a user story to be free, for example, you can enlarge it. However, according to INVEST, the user story should be brief. When you're laying the groundwork for a system, it's huge at first. When a user story is large, the technical tasks are usually large as well. You can also check the cost estimate to see if the big user story is affordable. You can make an MVP if the cost is low, but MVP stands for "minimum viable product." However, the MVP may be required to attend BAU on occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a user story is brand new, it frequently fails to meet INVEST's requirements. As a result, the new user story can be added to the planning process's idea section. Before adding a new user story to the backlog, the team checks to see if it has value or is estimatable. And when a tram user story has already fulfilled the INVEST requirement. You must decide what steps you will take. Each team has its own way of defining a user story. Another group requires a lengthy definition of a user story. Others, on the other hand, simply want to be brief. It's difficult to find the right determinant level. When you have too much, your efforts may be wasted, and when you don't have enough, you may make mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the project moves from the concept stage to the production stage, you'll need a higher level of detail. This means that there are other stages before the development stage, such as information architecture, which determines whether or not this is happening within your team. At each stage, you must have good communication skills. If there is a technical issue, a senior developer may be able to assist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acceptance criteria are the most common level of determination you'll need as a developer. Behavior-driven development is one method that works well in this situation. Where you'll talk about establishing acceptance criteria. Written communication is less effective than verbal communication. It's crucial to ask and answer questions about your team if you want to make a good decision. Verbal communication is used by some teams rather than written communication. "People over process," says the agile manifesto.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: break-all;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  Many people expect senior developers to attend meetings with stakeholders to figure out what they require. The stakeholder needs were written on a whiteboard at the time. However, in the twenty-first century, it is no longer done by a single person. Your stakeholder can tell you a problem in a workshop, which will help you figure out what your challenges are. This is done in order for the team to obtain useful information from stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of doing that solution and making a prototype right away, you have to see the problem and understand it completely before coming up with a solution. You will find a lot of problems in the double diamonds model, and you will find the most important problems. Then you'll discover a plethora of options, including the most pressing one. The order in which your workshops are held is determined by the stakeholders involved.
</p>
<p>
  The User Experience team conducts a requirement gathering process with users. Many successful businesses combine their development and user experience teams into one process. Quantitative research is only useful if your product is already in use by the user. It's very easy to get quantitative data using your analytics systems if you have a real user on your product. You can also use continuous delivery with this quantitative data to release a new feature early. In the requirement gathering process, the User Experience practitioner is your best ally.
