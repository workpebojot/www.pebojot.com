According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.

<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.

<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

According to Renz &amp; Katarina (2020), “Students and unemployed individuals are found to be highly vulnerable to COVID stress and its implications. Employed participants reported lower amount of COVID stress. It is possible that the employed participants were not required to report to work yet (work from home) which acted as a buffer against pandemic stress” (p. 94). The Philippines' unemployment rate for April surges to 17.7%, the highest ever on record, as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out jobs. Unemployment soared to 17.7% in April 2020, equivalent to around 7.3 million jobless Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020), due to this huge impact on Filipinos, the researcher decided to find ways to solve this problem with the help of technology to provide employment to the unemployed Filipinos, and to reduce the problem of every Filipino family.
</p>
<p>
One such ways is the Internet. The Internet is a useful tool for identifying potential employment opportunities like an Electronic Mail (E-Mail) notification. The E-mail notiﬁcations identiﬁed a number of vacancies in the 6-month period; 42% of all those advertised. The vast majority of descriptions and person speciﬁcations were available for downloading (Karen, 2007).
The researcher conducted a research about low Filipino employment rate and how to solve it. The researcher developed an android application to solve the problem. The android application, namely, Vacuum Cleaner application, is an application to develop the Household Chores Service Platform for Filipinos where they can deliver jobs and services from or to those who have jobs or have lost their job due to pandemic. The Android program allows Filipinos to provide work and services.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the android program has a small scope and conducted only in a small number of Barangay. It was developed at the end of November and it started its consecutive increments during December. The subject of the research is the local people of the Barangay in Dingalan, Aurora. It was developed because the pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown
</p>
<p>
It was done using a set of development technology like Android Studio, Linux Development Environment, Aspire ES1-432 Windows 10 Professional laptop with 1.10 GHz (Gigahertz), android smartphone Samsung SM-G532/DS version 6.1.0 Marshmallow to use and test the application with 1.5GB Random Access Memory (RAM).
</p>
<p>
The Vacuum application was created to solve the major problems faced by the Filipino people. First of all, unemployment, Vacuum application is an android application where Filipinos have the ability to share or find work, it is easier than other platforms that currently exist today like JobStreet because first, you do not need a diploma to find a job. This is because it is an obstacle for some poor Filipinos in life. The application is simplified, facilitating job sharing where others have the ability to enter into a job without difficulty

    <h3>Purpose and Description</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;word-break: keep-all;font-family:sans-serif;">
<p>
The purpose of this research is to define the issue about Filipino unemployment and to quantify solution based on segregate abstraction from the subjects. The nature of the topic dictates the use of document requirement to be filled by the subject. The Philippine Statistics Authority provides evidence that employment is an essential component of both the improvement of Filipino unemployment conditions and the positive development of a society. More extensive and enduring support would likely have allowed unemployed Filipinos the opportunity to further expand their career.
With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out workers, the Philippines' unemployment rate for April soared to 17.7 percent, the highest ever reported. In April 2020, unemployment increased to 17.7 percent, corresponding to around 7.3 million unemployed Filipinos in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Friday, June 5 (Ralf, 2020). With these numbers, if we do not act early, we may be assured that there is a huge economic loss.

According Mayen Jaymalin (2020), “A labor group fears a worse unemployment situation in the country this year, unless the government enforces the necessary intervention measures. Federation of Free Workers (FFW) president Sonny Matula warned that more workers will lose their jobs than last year if the government will not fund job facilitation programs” (para.). Matula said that several small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which form the bulk of businesses nationally, wouldn't be able to sustain the slump in industry due to the epidemic without state assistance.

Support from the government is extremely difficult to receive and many still require funds such as vaccine procurement funds. The government is still negotiating for the vaccine supply (Jamaine, 2020).

<p>
The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.
</p>
<p>
Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.

The researcher demonstrates his research concerns and theories in this section, the importance of the analysis, the aims and research issues. The researcher further proposed that more study be performed on the grounds of the research concerns. The topic has research issues that puzzled the researcher and a theory to conceptualize the approximation of the conclusions of the analysis. The information provided by the software application was accurate on the basis of the main findings of the research study, since the software architecture was developed based on the Principle of Least Astonishment, a system feature that behaves in a manner that is assumed by most users to behave.

Privacy, however, is the prime consideration, since another actor will still violate the privacy of the actor. Fortunately, the proposed software application did not violate the data gathering and data processing regulation or legislation because the proposed software application prevents the researcher from gathering suspicious data and processing data in a skeptic way, which is the most important aspect of privacy, all in all. The cognitive load was also the biggest problem. The researcher, however, restricts actor interactions to the system component, which then decreases their cognitive load and increases the usability of the software application.

The pandemic has disrupted the economy deeply, negatively impacting most industries and workers. By developing a smartphone application using software development resources such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, and the Linux operating system, the researcher solved the research issue. The researcher tested the application using compatibility and conformance checking based on the quality requirements of the Android Core App. The research study values close collaboration between Filipino employees, helping displaced Filipino employees and their families, fostering the welfare of Filipino employees and their families, coordinating and integrating numerous Filipino employees and unemployed workers, and supporting the Filipino unemployed to minimize the expense of finding a job by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The researcher proposed more studies on the unemployment rate or, more specifically, the Filipino unemployment rate. One such approach is to perform an investigation, an observation, or other method of data collection. And the researcher mush breaks it down into tasks on the basis of the obtained evidence or information that can make the software development process much easier to execute. To validate the application, the researcher should establish the architecture and design, development, and test case or criteria. To evaluate the application in real time and repeat the software development cycles after the released, monitoring tools can then be used.
