              Edison Nacional Pebojot is a software developer. Pebojot was raised in the Philippines and attended AMA
              Computer University. Pebojot was born in the Philippines. His parents were Jocelyn Pebojot and Eduardo
              Pebojot Sr. He were brought up in Aurora, a town in the Philippines. Pebojot was born in the Methodist
              Reformation, with roots originating from the Philippines. He's also a prolific listener and avid reader.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pebojot has also attended St. Patrick's Academy Inc., a Catholic high school. After two years, he went to
              Science High School in Surigao Del Sur, Philippines, where he studied Physics and Mathematics, where he
              graduated top three to his class. In his youth, he even engaged in the Philippine Science Youth Camp as an
              organizer and in The 2030 Project as a community member. Committed to meeting the 17th Framework of the
              United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pebojot noted that he had an interest in learning more about computer programming by the time he started
              classes at AMA Computer University. He studied Computer engineering and Information Technology. Throughout
              his freshman year, he developed a software called Braindotnet, which enabled users to read a topic, take
              quizzes, and monitor progress. A short time later, he revamped the software to encourage students to
              report their results via Really Simple Syndication. <sup><a
