        Now, I mentioned Scrum, Kanban, and Scrumban yesterday (for small teams). Additionally, Prince2 Agile and PMI (for big teams). At some point in our personal lives, we all want to improve ourselves. But the improvement I'm referring to is for the Kanban team, specifically for their standards/culture. I'd like to start with small teams because, after all, we all start small and work our way up, right? Okay, that's enough for now.
    </p>
    <h4>Continual Improvement</h4>
    <p>
        We've all heard the phrase "continuous improvement." Essentially, it was changed to continual improvement due to the semantics of the word itself, as continuous refers to improvement through repetition, whereas continual refers to improvement through scaling. So, we have scaling vs. repeating. You improve by repeating the standard/culture rather than scaling it to something better if you use continuous improvement 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if you use continual improvement, you can improve by scaling up the standard/culture without having to repeat it. As a result, the semantics of the latter are far superior to the former. Because there was a debate among the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/21823.html" target="_blank">ISO 9001:2000</a> developers about the meaning of continuous improvement, <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/53882.html" target="_blank">ISO/TC 176</a> changed it.
    </p>
    <h4>Retrospective</h4>
    <p>
        In any case, we want to raise our standards/culture. Every business culture/standard is distinct in its own way. You'll also need to scale yours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scaling your standards/culture is simple in Scrum. Go at <a href="https://retromat.org/" target="_blank">Retromat</a> and scroll down to learn how to do a retrospective in scrum. Although there are ordered stages that you must follow, I recommend that you click on each hashtag for each stage and try them out:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Set the stage (<a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=122" target="_blank">#122</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
                Gather data (<a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=51" target="_blank">#51</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
                Generate insights (<a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=9" target="_blank">#9</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
                Decide what to do (<a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=39" target="_blank">#39</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
                Close the retrospective (<a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=60" target="_blank">#60</a>)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        This should be done every 1-2 weeks sprints, in scrum, of course. The story is different in Kanban.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scaling your standards/culture in Kanban is difficult. In Kanban, you'll need an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A3_problem_solving" target="_blank">A3 Problem Solving</a> (method), an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A3_problem_solving#/media/File:A3_problem_solving_worksheet.jpg" target="_blank">A3 Problem Solving Template</a> (paper), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA" target="_blank">PDCA</a> (design), a <a href="https://www.reliableplant.com/root-cause-analysis-31548" target="_blank">Root Cause Analysis Tool</a> (lean tool), and an <a href="https://www.targetprocess.com/blog/development-practice-retrospectives-in-kanban/" target="_blank">Issue board</a> (board) to conduct a retrospective.
    </p>
    <p>
       The A3 Problem Solving is the first (method). It's self-explanatory if you use an A3 Problem Solving Template (paper), which is an A3-size piece of paper like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38276345/130525644-b2bc26f4-41cf-40d6-8d66-e9c200a16f24.jpg" class="img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Figure 1. A3 Problem Solving Template (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A3_problem_solving#/media/File:A3_problem_solving_worksheet.jpg" target="_blank">source</a>)</figcaption>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can now use the PDCA (design), and Root Cause Analysis Tool (lean tool).
    </p>
    <p>
        Plan:
        <ol>
            <li>Clarify the problem</li>
            <li>Breakdown the problem</li>
            <li>Set the target</li>
            <li>Analyze the Root Cause - use the <a href="https://www.reliableplant.com/root-cause-analysis-31548" target="_blank">Root Cause Analysis Tool</a> (lean tool)</li>
            <li>Develop counter measures</li>
         </ol>
         Do: <br>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Implement countermeasures
        <br>
        Check: <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Monitor Results and Process
        <br>h
        Adjust: <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Standardize and share success
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are stages in scrum that must be followed in order (stages). You must use an A3 Problem Solving in Kanban (method). Every 1-2-week sprint in scrum, you must conduct a retrospective. In Kanban, an Issue board (board) is required to conduct a retrospective.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, your problems/issues are collected on the issue board (board). The number of problems/issues on the issue board (board) is actually limited to 5. Only if the issue board (board) now contains 5 problems/issues does a retrospective take place. The issuer of issue should clarify the problem, break the problem into smaller parts and set the target (or goal). 
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem/issue must now be transferred to the A3 Problem Solving Template (paper), PDCA (design), and use Root Cause Analysis Tool (lean tool) so that we can determine the root cause of the issue and develop countermeasures (solution). If the the results in the implementation of the solution is working, use it to change your standards or culture.
    </p>
    <h4>Physical vs Virtual (Retrospective)</h4>
    <p>
        You may now be physically working, usually in a building. Try the above if you want to conduct a retrospective. Try the (stages) for scrum. You can use the (method) for kanban. However, we may work remotely on occasion, and in this case, retrospective is a little different because our standards/culture have changed as a result of the pandemic. You should try to use a retrospective tool if you are working remotely and want to conduct a retrospective. Try the <a href="https://www.retrium.com/" target="_blank">Retrium</a> or <a href="https://www.leancoffeetable.com/" target="_blank">Lean Coffee Tables</a> for scrum. You can use Trello, Zoom, or Webex for Kanban.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a little more difficult in Kanban because we frequently use (method) rather than (stages). To put it another way, in Kanban, we have an Issue board (board) in Trello where we can put 5 issues. Why are there only 5 issues? It usually depends on your team, but keep in mind that in Kanban, each column in the Kanban board has a N + 1 value. This means that if the issue board has 4 people in charge, we can add another issue to them. If there are 4 people, there must be 5 issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than being members of the specific team, these 4 people are members of the general team. Why? Because they'll do some planning, implementation, monitoring and standardization that are not specificically pass to the specific team. They will now conduct the retrospective if there are 5 issues on the issue board. Typically, they will discuss the issue in a zoom or webex session while holding an A3-size paper/document.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tool time is a method of resolving an issue by the entire team. Tool time is named after the general team's decision to use various <a href="http://resources.hartfordtechnologies.com/blog/the-ultimate-list-of-lean-manufacturing-tools" target="_blank">lean manufacturing tools to resolve the problem.
    </p>
    <h4>RPD and DxA</h4>
    <p>
        They need to know the Retrospective Prime Directive (or RPD) and Discussion vs. Action (DxA) while discussing the issue in a zoom or webex session. In RPD, they discuss without blaming the problem on the team member who caused it (or mistake). If you blame them, this is bad because they may not open an issue again because they are afraid of being caught. In DxA, action takes precedence over discussion, because retrospective is pointless unless there is a change in standard/culture.
    </p>
    <h4>Debt</h4>
    <p>
        You may be familiar with the term "technical debt." Instead of issue boards, they're common on bug triage boards. The main difference is that the bug triage board primarily focuses on code issues, with the development team instead of the management team in charge, whereas the issue board primarily focuses on general issues such as:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Architecture Debt</li>
            <li>Infrastructure Debt</li>
            <li>Documentation Debt</li>
            <li>Monetary Debt</li>
            <li>Technical Debt</li>
            <li>And more</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        On the issue board, the one in charge is the general team instead of the development team. If debts are increasing, they can speed up the system's entropy. To slow down system entropy, the boy scout rule should be used to reduce debt. According to boy scout rules, you must clean something before moving it from left to right on the Kanban board.        
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Every business culture/standard is distinct in its own way. Scaling your standards/culture is simple in Scrum, but it's different in Kanban. In Kanban, you'll need an A3 Problem Solving (method), a PDCA (design), a Root Cause Analysis Tool (lean tool) and an Issue board (board) Every 1-2 weeks in scrum, you must conduct a retrospective. This should be done every 1 to 2 weeks, of course. If you don't scale up the standard/culture, you have to repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try the Retrium or Lean Coffee Tables for scrum. You can use Trello, Zoom, or Webex for Kanban. Try the (method) for kanban if you are working remotely and want to conduct a retrospective. If there are 5 issues on an issue board, there must be 5 people in charge of them. The general team will conduct the retrospective if there are more than 5 issues. They will discuss the issue while holding an A3-size paper/document.
