        So, in my previous blog, I discussed debt. Other types of debt exist, such as architecture debt, infrastructure debt, and so on, but I'd like to focus on technical debt today because it is the most common type of debt in the software industry. As a result, one of the most common topics discussed by experienced programmers in the software industry is technical debt. So, when we talk about technical debt, we're actually talking about software defects. Because the term bug can refer to insects, some people prefer to refer to it as a defect, because a defect is the result of a mistake. This is called Mistake metamorphism.
    </p>
    <p>
        In mistake metamorphism, when we change some parts of the source code, we may need to change other parts of the source code as well in order for the software to function properly. Unfortunately, some of us would rather not change certain other parts (or components) for various reasons (maybe because it was hard to change). This is a mistake. And this mistake continues to flow through the pipeline (or Kanban board). That mistake slowly transforms into something dark as it travels through the pipeline. It's so dark that it's now considered a defect in the pipeline's final stage (deployment). And that defect can result in software that isn't up to par. It means that some of it is functional, but not all of it is. For example, clicking the button is working, but clicking the anchor is not.
    </p>
    <p>
        When some parts of a programme work before but not after a change, this is referred to as software regression (defect). Some defects, however, are unintentional. For example, just because you change some parts of the source code and leave the rest alone to make the software work perfectly does not mean there isn't a defect. It could be due to incompatibilities that cause the software to perform poorly. Some parts (components) of your software, for example, may not work in the runtime environment. This is due to the execution model's inability to comprehend your source code. It's possible that the execution model from that runtime entails using "if statement" with parenthesis instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Software incompatibility is the term for this type of incompatibility. It's also possible that you made some mistakes that were unintentional. It's possible that the runtime environment has been updated and no longer supports the programming language features you're using (or vice versa). And it's here that forward and backward compatibility is established. Forward compatibility is used when your software needs to work flawlessly with a new version of the runtime environment. Backward compatibility is available for older versions of the runtime environment. Because your system is still young and mistakes are common, you're more likely to encounter intentional defects in greenfield projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Defect triage, on the other hand, can be used to manage defects. Some tools, such as Github or Trello, refer to this as bug triage, but this is incorrect. If you rely on these tools excessively, you may be justified in using the term bug triage during working hours, and you may disagree with me. Using the word defect, on the other hand, is transparent because it indicates that you made a mistake, which you should not hide from the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, the most common method of defect triage is through the use of a tool and a casual meeting. To avoid infobesity, the tool includes a defect triage board (board), four columns (open, high priority, low priority, closed), and a WiP limit for each column. The developer who made the mistake in the version control system should speak with the tester during the casual meeting. Some prefer to speak with stakeholders and product owners because they are more familiar with the scope of the technical debt's impact and may be able to offer useful solutions. Some people prefer to use an issue board instead of talking to stakeholders and product owners. An issue board is preferable because it allows more people to discuss the problem than just the developer and tester.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than adding a defect to the issue board, some developers prefer to avoid mistakes right away. However, some errors are unintentional, such as software incompatibility. But mistakes can also be reduced to a bare minimum. As a result, we must prioritise and estimate the issue. You need to know the issue's value and size in order to prioritise and estimate it. The output of resolving the problem must be useful to the user, and the impact should be minimal. It should be kept to a minimum because a large impact means a large mistake. And, no matter how significant the impact, most users will not value what you fix if the issue is not valuable. This can lead to a waste of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to size and value, people use velocity (for scrum) and time (for kanban). In fact, in software development, velocity and time are critical because they are used to communicate with stakeholders. The standard deviation formula is used to calculate the mean of the total number of story points in four sprints over the course of a month. However, because the velocity has no units like tasks per minute, there are trust issues between the team and the stakeholders. As a result, some people attempt to convert velocity to time. For instance, 30 points equals 6 days, 60 points equals 12 days, and so on. T-shirt sizing and the cone of uncertainty are also used by some people to communicate with stakeholders, but this is beyond the scope of this blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, some people prefer to use time (in kanban). You use time in kanban to communicate with stakeholders about how long they should expect their product to arrive. Lead time, cycle time, and actionable agile metrics (ACM) are used to calculate time. I won't go into detail because it's much better if you investigate it for yourself to gain a better understanding. All of this talk about velocity and time, on the other hand, is a way of communicating to stakeholders how long it will take to fix the defect. You'll need a way to explain to stakeholders how long they should wait for the fix, especially if the defect is valuable.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Technical debt is the most common type of debt in the software industry. Technical debt refers to software defects, which can be caused by mistake and incompatibilities. Some people prefer to refer to it as a defect, because a defect is the result of a mistake. In mistake metamorphism, when we change some parts of the source code, we may need to change other parts too. And this mistake slowly transforms into something dark as it travels through the pipeline.

        It's so dark that it's now considered a defect in the pipeline's final stage (deployment) And that defect can result in software that isn't up to par.
