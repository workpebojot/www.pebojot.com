    <p>
        So, last month, I talked about how to create your first task when gathering functional requirements for your system, which can also include non-functional requirements. I'd like to discuss how you can handle these tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scrum and Kanban are common task management tools in software development, but they're mostly used to track your work in a graphical chart called a burn down/up chart (for scrum) and a cumulative flow diagram (for Kanban).
    </p>
    <p>
        There are other more advanced task management or project management methods and standards in software development, such as Prince2 Agile (method) and PMI (standard), which we will discuss later. So, first and foremost, let's talk about Scrum.
    </p>
    <h4>Scrum</h4>
    <p>
        By the way, what is a scrum? Let's take a look at its history to get a better understanding of it. Scrum is based on the cargo cult belief system. What is the origin of the term "cargo cult"? Its meaning is self-evident. During World War 2, the most accurate explanation of the cargo cult was given. Anyway, we won't go over the entire history, but the reason I'm mentioning it is because a lot of cargo fell from the sky during World War 2. It was intended for the soldiers, but the islanders of Melanesia in the Pacific mistook it for a divine gift.
    </p>
    <p>
        Is that clear? So, after World War II, these islanders in Melanesia, a Pacific island, performed rituals in the hopes of the God dropping more cargo. As a result, these rituals have become a part of their daily routine. However, they are unaware that their beliefs make them ignorant because they do not attempt to comprehend why those cargos fell from the sky in the first place. Perhaps they are unaware that World War II occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we apply this to software development, the same thing happens, which is unfortunate for anyone who is caught up in these rituals. Regrettably, there are rituals in Scrum as well (Oh no). In which a software developer follows a software development process and repeats the same process on a daily basis without realising it. Their beliefs make them ignorant because they don't try to understand why something is happening; instead, they just do it, believing that the faster you work, the more successful the software product will be (but not).
    </p>
    <p>
        In reality, this is not the case, because competence is what determines whether software products will succeed or fail, rather than simply working on them and getting better at them to make them successful. There are Cargo cult programming practises like shotgun debugging and deep magic (among others) in Scrum, for example. If someone, does it, they try to copy code from the internet and paste it into their code editor with little knowledge of how it works. This is incompetence, and other Scrum team members may experience imposter syndrome as a result. Working on it and getting better at it causes us to lose sight of the process we're following.
    </p>
    <h5>Product Backlog</h5>
    <p>
        There is a product backlog in Scrum. It's similar to a to-do list where you write down all of your tasks. If these tasks are added to the product backlog, they are now known as product backlog items (or just PBI). These PBIs could be either functional or non-functional requirements. We also know that user stories are used to create these PBIs (refer to my old blog). However, it is the product owner who prioritises PBIs and estimates their size in the product backlog. He/she usually refers to it by the acronym INVEST.
    </p>
    <h5>Team</h5>
    <p>
        We heard from the product owner now, but not from the other members. In scrum, the team is usually quite small. Because they're so small, they're divided into three columns: product owner, developer, and scrum master. Scrum uses a cross-functional organisational structure rather than a functional one. And the members of the team are self-managing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The scrum master is an important column in the scrum. The scrum master is the person in charge of removing roadblocks to the delivery of the product that has been identified in the daily standup (it is a short meeting). The project manager differs from the Scrum master in that the project manager has people management skills, whereas the Scrum master does not.
    </p>
    <h5>Transition of PBIs</h5>
    <p>
        So, think of a PBI as an item flowing through the pipeline once more (like oil). We're not talking about oil or the definition of the word here in the dictionary; rather, we're talking about the PBI's Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD). Before we put it into development in DoR, we need to know if it's ready. And we need to know if the item is done before we put it into production. For example, in DoR, the product owner may prioritise the item and estimate its size before putting it into development, whereas in DoD, the item must be tested first before going into production, correct? In any case, we don't want bugs.
    </p>
    <h5>Story Pointing</h5>
    <p>
        So, we now know that user stories are similar to wishes written on index cards. Let's say we gathered 60 index cards with our respondents' wishes on them. This allows us to categorise similar wishes into epics. Separate the epics into smaller tasks, which are now known as PBIs, and place them in the product backlog. We can't, however, simply add the task to the product backlog.
    </p>
    <p>
        We must first provide them with story points. The purpose of story points is to help with task prioritisation and estimation. The lower the estimate, the higher the priority, and the smaller the story points of the tasks (size). Even if the story points of the tasks are smaller, the estimate (size) can be higher. For example, just because the tasks are more important doesn't mean the impact will be smaller; it could be even larger at some point. Even if the story point is small, a simple sign-up button, for example, can have a large impact on a large number of users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Planning poker is one method of assigning story points to tasks. You give each member of your team a card. To avoid anchoring cognitive bias, they can write the task's story points on the card without telling the rest of the team. Anchoring is a cognitive bias in which other team members influence a decision.
    </p>
    <h5>Small Meeting</h5>
    <p>
        We have a small meeting called daily stand-up in Scrum, which can take as little as 15-20 minutes. The main goal is to quickly identify roadblocks, with each team member sharing something that makes their development more difficult to implement. The scrum master, product owner, developers, and stakeholders were mostly present at the meeting. The blockers should be noted by the Scrum master.
    </p>
    <h5>Burn up/down charts</h5>
    <p>
        We now use a burnup chart and a burndown chart in Scrum. They're actually two different graphs. An x-axis and a y-axis are used in burndown charts. The number of remaining works (number of remaining work) is on the y-axis, and the number of days is on the x-axis (number of days). This is actually bad if the number of remaining works and the number of days increase. As the number of days passes, the number of remaining works should decrease.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also have an x-axis and a y-axis in burnup charts. The number of completed works (number of completed work) is on the y-axis, and the number of days is on the x-axis (number of days). If the total number of completed works is greater than the total number of days, this is good. It is bad if the number of completed works is lower than the number of days passed.
    </p>
    <h4>Kanban</h4>
    <p>
        So, now that we've discussed Scrum, there's another task/project management tool to consider: Kanban. I'm going to go over a quick history of it. We've all heard of lean manufacturing. It is commonly used in the hardware industry, such as automobiles. The car passes through the pipeline, which gradually assembles individual hardware components such as the engine, radiator beam, and engine cover into a functional vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was used because the delivery of these separate hardware parts, such as the engine, radiator beam, engine cover, and so on, was either too early or too late back in the day. These can cause bottlenecks because if the engine or radiator beam is too early, it can increase the receiver's work; however, if the engine or radiator beam is too late, it can decrease the receiver's work and cause it to be rejected, resulting in wasted work for the sender who built those hardware parts. The delivery of hardware parts is sometimes not too early or too late, but the hardware parts may contain human errors, such as an engine or radiator beam that does not work properly.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can now connect lean manufacturing in the hardware industry to lean manufacturing in the software industry. We use a Kanban board instead of a pipeline. We have separate software parts like the search bar, footer, tab bar, and so on, instead of separate hardware parts like the engine, radiator beam, and engine cover.
    </p>
    <p>
        We used a Kanban board because the delivery of these software parts, such as the search bar, footer, and tab bar, was either too early or too late back in the day. These can cause bottlenecks because if the search bar or footer is too early, it may increase the receiver's tasks; however, if the search bar or footer is too late, it may decrease the receiver's tasks and cause it to be rejected, resulting in wasted work for the sender. When software parts are delivered on time, there is a chance that human error will occur, such as the search bar or footer not working properly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We have separate columns on the Kanban board for "to-do," "doing," and "done," with each task moving from left to right. Each column, however, has a Work-in-Progress limit (or WiP limit). As a result, each column's tasks are limited. Because it balances the receiver's tasks, this WiP limit helps us avoid bottlenecks (no increase in task, no decrease in task). However, even if the task is balanced, there is no guarantee that the software components delivered will function correctly. As a result, there is an Entry/Exit criteria between each column (like DoR and DoD in Scrum). That is all there is to it. This Entry/Exit criterion aids us in avoiding human error in the flow of software components through the Kanban board.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Burn up/burn down charts are used in Scrum. The Cumulative Flow Diagram is used in Kanban (CFD). We have an x-axis and a y-axis in CFD. The number of tasks in each column on the Kanban board is represented on the y-axis. The number of days is represented on the x-axis. As the number of days increases, the number of tasks should decrease. Because there is a problem if the lines in the CFD graph do not remain flat.
    </p>
    <h4>Scrumban</h4>
    <p>
        I describe how bad Scrum is in the first part. Scrumban was born out of this need. Scrumban is similar to peanut butter on a sandwich. Scrumban was created as a bridge between Scrum and Kanban. It was not actually intended to combine the two, but combined them to help us transition to kanban.
    </p>
    <h4>Prince2 and PMI</h4>
    <p>
        We previously discussed project management tools such as scrum and Kanban (or even scrumban). However, there is a more advanced project management tool known as Prince2 and Project Management Professional (PMP).
    </p>
    <p>
        Prince2 is a project management methodology. It is, in fact, the de facto standard for project management throughout the UN system. You can use Prince2 Agile specifically for the software industry. Keep in mind that Prince2 is a very complex project management method that is typically applied to large projects. It is not always necessary to use Prince2 for smaller projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PMP is a project management professional certification based on standardised project management principles. The PMP exam requires you to apply standardised project management principles. These standardised project management principles can be applied to the software industry to improve project success rates.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Scrum is based on the cargo cult belief system. It involves a software developer repeating the same process every day without realising it. This leads to imposter syndrome, in which they lose sight of what's going on and get stuck in the rut.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scrum is a cross-functional organisational structure where members of the team are self-managing. The Scrum master is the person in charge of removing roadblocks to the delivery of the product that has been identified in the daily standup (it is a short meeting) The purpose of story points is to help with task prioritisation and estimation. The smaller the story points of the task, the higher the priority, and the lower the estimate (size) Even if the story point is small, a simple sign-up button can have a large impact on users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lean manufacturing is commonly used in the hardware industry, such as automobiles. The delivery of hardware parts is sometimes not too early or late, but the software parts may contain human errors. Kanban board allows you to organize tasks into "to-do," "doing," and "done" columns. The Cumulative Flow Diagram is used in Kanban (CFD) The number of tasks in each column on the Kanban board is represented on the y-axis. As the number of days increases, the x-axis should decrease as the CFD graph flattens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scrumban was created as a bridge between Scrum and Kanban. It was not actually intended to combine the two, but combined them to help us transition to Kanban in the first part of this article. The second part describes how bad Scrum is.
