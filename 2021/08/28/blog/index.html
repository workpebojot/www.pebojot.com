    <p>
        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.
    </p>

        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.

        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.

        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.

        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.

        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.

        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.

        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.
    </p>

We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.

    <p>
        Defects are common in software development, as we all know. When you come across it, you can be sure that stakeholders are unhappy with it, and they will ask you how long they should wait for a fix (or changes). You can try to tell them the time, but they are interested in more than just the time. They care about how the changes are delivered. In software development, the product that can change the most quickly in a constrained environment win, while those who are slow to change lose. As a result, mistakes must be discovered early, and changes must be delivered quickly. Change delivery necessitates some practice (practice) and a software engineering approach (approach), so we must employ continuous integration (practice), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (approach).
    </p>
    <p>
         So, first and foremost, I'd like to discuss continuous integration (or CI). It's more of a (practice) than a tool. The tool is designed to aid in practice. Back in the day, we used source code management (SCM) in a source code control system (SCCS). Branching and merging were common in SCM for code review (CR) purposes, similar to what developers do in extreme programming (XP). They review each other's code, that's right. In branching, every branch should go to the CR branch, but the problem is that other branches' changes are too late or too early, so merging to the CR branch produces contradictory results because two changes from two branches collide, and they reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, researchers are considering new practices to solve the problem, one of which is to use continuous integration (CI). CI is a practice similar to what we do in XP, but it does not involve branching or merging. Instead, there is only one mainline, and you must commit to that mainline every day. This is referred to as a daily build. Mistakes are discovered early in a daily build, and if the build fails, it can be quickly identified, and the changes can then be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what should we do if the build goes well? We must, of course, test in the build. Testing in the build is more than just that. Because CI necessitates the use of a test suite. The term test suite refers to a collection of test cases (with a test case ID). This means that for each defect-fix commit (with an issue ID on the issue board), that defect-fix commit will be tracked separately using a traceability matrix. And if it passes, we generate executables, which we then deploy. Even if you used continuous integration back then, some people did manual building, manual testing, and manual deployment, which made CI slower. As a result, we'll need a strategy for dealing with automation. Here's where the CI/CD comes in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, now I'd like to discuss continuous delivery (CD). Remember that when we use CD, we're using an (approach) rather than a tool like Jenkins or GoCD. Only those approaches will benefit from the tool, which will automate some tasks such as building, testing, and deploying. When you use a Kanban system, you can make better use of CDs (the pipeline). As an example, consider a pipeline. Each pipeline has different stages, as we all know. As an example, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 1: Research (manual) <br />
        Stage 2: Architecture (software or system) and Design (manual) <br />
        Stage 3: Development (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing (manual or automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated) <br />
        Stage 6: Monitoring <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Stages 3 to 5 can be automated, but not completely, because some sub-stages are still required because each stage can be broken down even further. As an example,
    </p>
    <p>
        Stage 3: Development <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 code commit (manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 code review (automated or manual) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.1 check code style/standard <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.2 rearrange code <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3 check copyright <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.4 etc. <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 version control system (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4 automation server (Jenkins or GoCD) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4.1 build (automated) <br />
        Stage 4: Testing <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 unit test (automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 acceptance test (manual or automated) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 release (automated) <br />
        Stage 5: Deployment (automated)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that code review in the IDE can be automated, but not in text/code editors such as VS Code or Notepad++. It's also worth noting that we have "manual or automated" on the same stage. This implies that the stage can be further subdivided. For example, in acceptance testing, there is regression testing (automated), sanity testing (manual) and more. In stage 4.3, the release, they can be executables like jar files (Java) or static files (JavaScript). It indicates that the files are ready for deployment, and that the files will be deployed using a CD automatically. Smaller items flow through the pipeline faster than larger items. This is to avoid making major mistakes. If the items are small, the mistakes are small, and fixing them if they occur is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a successful build can still fail in production due to software incompatibility, some developers use feature toggle to ensure that if one feature fails in production, we can turn it off. The tasks in the pipeline are synchronous, and at each stage, people with varying skills may be involved. Researchers are involved in the first stage. They could be data scientists, such as data miners, machine learning scientists, or big data analysts, among other things. Software architects, system architects, information architects, UX designers, and even psychologists are involved in the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because they need to create documentation (or specification) so that the developers can put it into practice. Isn't this documentation familiar to us? We know this because when we use community dependencies (such as open-source libraries), we read the documentation. However, in commercial dependency, some documentation is private and only available within the enterprise. As a result, in my next blog, I'd like to discuss stage 2, the architecture and design.
